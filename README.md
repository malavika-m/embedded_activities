#### Details:
> The code is based on a car seat heater scenerio. When the passenger is seated and heater button is pressed an LED switches ON. By varying the knob we can adjust the we can adjust temperature as per requirement. A potentiometer reads the values and the AVR328 micrococntroller converts  analog into digital values using ADC. PWM pulses are generated as instructed and temperature messages will be displayed in Serial Monitor using USART.
